# INTRODUCTION 
Kotha Khojau is a room rental application that acts as a platform for people to look for free spaces 
that are available near their desired location and allows its users to give their property for rent.Traditional methods to look for places available for rent are still quite common today. In the context of Nepal, people still rely on old ways of finding and renting rooms which are quite hectic and time consuming. To overcome this type of problem, an interface is needed which allows the user 
to check out rooms that are available for rent and can be used for putting up properties for rent as 
well. On top of that, a medium should be created to connect people to shipping agencies and drivers 
for shipping purposes. <br><br>

# AIM
Design and implement a computerized and functional application that permits users to search for rooms or living spaces for tenant purposes, reducing the hassle and manual work of looking and managing details, location, prices, and shipment of goods while moving out and into a new place.
<br><br>

Some major features of this application are as follows:
- Users can make a new account using their phone number and e-mail
- A notification is given to rewriting the phone number if it detects a shortage in the number of 
  digits

  intentions for using the application
- Account verification through email address.

# TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED 
We have used a wide variety of tools for this project. The scrum master had to make user stories for 
assigning duties, so Excel was used ever other week. For making prototype of the project, we sticked 
with figma as our primary option. As we executed this code using Java, we relied on Intellij for the 
development and for database we relied on MySQL Workbench.
